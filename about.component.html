  <h4 class="my-2 font-weight-bold font-italic">Overview</h4>
  <p>Onedrop is a name given to a blood bank management system, which is a full-stack web application, where user can
    search blood anonymously, however for requesting blood or for registering into a camp a user need to be
    authenticated.
    The main idea is to connect all the blood banks and needy people on a single platform to help each other by save
    lives and time.</p>
  <p>A user can register on onedrop and request blood as well as register into a camp either as a donor or volunteer.
    For registering into a camp as a volunteer, the user can select a role of a volunteer as per their interest. For
    each successful request or transaction the user will receive a email which would be the proof for the same.
    The main goal was to learn Spring boot and Angular. This project was made to show what we have learned.</p>
  <h4 class="my-2 font-weight-bold font-italic">Technology Used</h4>
  <p class="mb-0">As we all know , a full-stack web application could be divide into 3 parts:</p>
  <ol style="margin-left: -10px">
    <li>Front-end</li>
    <li>Back-end</li>
    <li>Database</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="mb-0 font-italic">You can read about difference between a website and web application <a

  <p>The <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold text-danger">Front-end( User Interface and interaction)</span> of
    this web application is made using angular (CLI). Angular is component based framework build on typescript (superset
    of javascript) for creating single page web application. We have used angular with <a class="font-italic"
      href="https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/documentation" target="_blank">NGX-boostrap</a>. You can read
    more about angular cli <a class="font-italic" href="https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular"
      target="_blank">here</a>. Some other component which i have used are <a class="font-italic"
      href="https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr" target="_blank">Ngx-toastr</a> and <a class="font-italic"
      href="https://github.com/t-ho/ngx-ui-loader" target="_blank">Ngx-ui-loader</a>. </p>
  <p>The <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold text-danger">Back-end(Data processing and Business logic)</span> of
    this web application is made using spring boot, which is an open source java-based framework used to create
    stand-alone web application, that you can “just run”.
    You can read more about it <a class="font-italic" href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot"
      target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>The <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold text-danger">Database(Storing data)</span> contains information like
    units of blood given, available blood, requested blood, user credentials etc. For this web application we are using
    mySql for storing data. MySQL is used to store structured data and we can INSERT, EDIT, DELETE and ALTER the
    database using MySQL query. You can read more about it <a class="font-italic" href="https://www.mysql.com/"
      target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <h4 class="my-2 font-weight-bold font-italic">Future</h4>
  <p class="mb-0">We have followed a monolithic approach to create the back-end, however now days <a
      href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/07/14/microservices-with-spring" target="_blank"
      class=" font-italic">microservice architecture</a> is followed everywhere.It will be releasing
    a modified version of the back-end using a microservice architecture, or a new project using micro-service.</p>
